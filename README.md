The final objective is to analyse the data in a way which 
helps them to accurately judge their business performance.
We have created a consolidated 
and interactive PowerBI report from where we can easily analyse the following information. 
1) Total number of restaurants across Continents, Countries and Cities. 
 
2)  the capability to view information at a global level. But at the same time the 
ability to go down to a granular level as well. 
 
3) Top performing restaurants by average customer ratings. 
 
4) Top performing restaurants by least average cost. 
 
5) Ability to filter and view the restaurant details (address, cuisines served â€¦) by,  
a. Geographic dimensions like Continent, Country and City. 
b. If the restaurant offers services like, online delivery or table booking. 
c. Rating colours denoting the average rating slab.
